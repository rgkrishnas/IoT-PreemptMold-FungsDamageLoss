# IoT - Pre-emptive Mold & Fungus Damage Loss

## Objective
Aim is to provide a solution to avoid home damges due to climate changes, using IoT technology pre-empty the situation and keep healthy life/building strengthen as well avoid insurance claims.
## Goal:
* Mold is a common type of fungus that thrives in moist, warm conditions. 
* The spores they release causes illness to humans.
* Buildings get damaged due to fungus
* The growth of mold claims has been exponential in the past years
* Sizable mold claims are pending in the United States, particularly in Florida, California, Texas, and Arizona. 
 - Results into insurance claim as well as health issue. 

## Features:
* Using IoT/sensing technology, data (moisture, humidity, temperature, Light Sensitive, etc.) will be collected, transmitted, stored, processed and visualized. 
* “Anomaly detection” machine learning algorithm will be used to decide whether indoor situations are favorable for mold/fungi.
* Meaningful information gets shared with users on their mobile APP/ email inbox. The information will be used to pre-notify the users to take preventive measures to avoid any potential future loss.
